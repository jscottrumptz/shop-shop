// With these three actions, we're defining how three parts of our state will be maintained and updated:

// UPDATE_PRODUCTS is used by the ProductList component. Right now, we're getting all of our product
// data from the server, and Apollo caches the results. This is great for performance, but it also
// means we have to go through Apollo every time we want to update that list. The end goal here is
// to store the data retrieved for products by Apollo in this global state. This way, we can add
// offline capabilities later and persist our product data!
export const UPDATE_PRODUCTS = "UPDATE_PRODUCTS";

// UPDATE_CATEGORIES works a lot like UPDATE_PRODUCTS in that we want to take the list of categories
// retrieved from the server by Apollo and store it in this global state. Again, this will allow us
// to easily add offline capabilities at a future point in this project.
export const UPDATE_CATEGORIES = "UPDATE_CATEGORIES";

// UPDATE_CURRENT_CATEGORY is sort of the connecting piece of data for the previous two actions we
// created, in that we want to be able to select a category from the state created by the
// UPDATE_CATEGORIES action and display products for that category from the list we create from the
// UPDATE_PRODUCTS action.
export const UPDATE_CURRENT_CATEGORY = "UPDATE_CURRENT_CATEGORY";

// These statements represent all of the actions you might want to perform with a shopping cart,
// from adding a single item to adding multiple items at once.
